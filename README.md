# An Advanced Signature Scheme: Schnorr algorithm and its Benefits to the Bitcoin Ecosystem

This thesis has been realized for the Master of Science in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. 

## Abstract
Nowadays in the Bitcoin protocol it is used ECDSA as underlying digital signature scheme: its drawbacks are well known, but a solution exists. The Schnorr signature algorithm, although lacking a standardization, is superior in every aspect to ECDSA. Starting from the mathematical and cryptographic foundations, the aim of this work is to present the two schemes, delve into the technicalities of their comparison and study the benefits to higher level constructions allowed by Schnorr (multi-signatures, threshold signatures, cross-chain atomic swaps and the Lightning Network). The discussion proceeds according to the recent BIP by Pieter Wuille about Schnorr's Bitcoin standardization.
