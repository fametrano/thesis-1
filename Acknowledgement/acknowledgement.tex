\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{chpr:acknowledgement}

First of all, I would start to thank the supervisors of the present work: my gratitude goes to Prof. Ametrano, who introduced me to Bitcoin and its nature, inspired me with his passion for the subject and assisted me in the learning process, and to Prof. Marazzina, who gave me countless advices and tips during the drawing up of the thesis. Then I would like to thank the experts whose work is the backbone of mine: they are too many to fit in few lines, but hopefully I will give them credit throughout the thesis. Furthermore, I would like to express my immense gratitude to my family and friends, for always having supported me during my years of study.

Finally, I would like to thank my mother and my girlfriend, Ludovica: thank you for having been always by my side; thank you for having inspired me more than anybody else. This journey would not have been possible without you.

Thank you.
